Condition variables are synchronization primitives that enable threads to wait until a particular condition occurs. Condition variables are user-mode objects that cannot be shared across processes.

Condition variables enable threads to atomically release a lock and enter the sleeping state. They can be used with critical sections or slim reader/writer (SRW) locks. Condition variables support operations that "wake one" or "wake all" waiting threads. After a thread is woken, it re-acquires the lock it released when the thread entered the sleeping state.
